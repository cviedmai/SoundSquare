SoundSquare lets you attach SoundCloud tracks to FourSquare venues and listen to what others have put.

You have to define your consumer Key and Consumer secret codes for the API access to SoundCloud and FourSquare as environmental variables.
The variables are: ENV['SC_CONSUMER_TOKEN'], ENV['SC_CONSUMER_SECRET'], ENV['FS_CONSUMER_TOKEN'] and ENV['FS_CONSUMER_SECRET']
